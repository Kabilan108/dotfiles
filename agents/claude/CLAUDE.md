# system info

the current machine runs nixos with a custom home-manager configuration. you can find the flake at ~/dotfiles/flake.nix.

tools for a variety of languages are installed in the home environment, but where necessary, project specific dependencies will be made available via a flake. the nix-direnv tool will typically be used to automatically start the flake's dev shell.

# LSP Usage

Use the LSP tool to check for errors, explore code, and debug. The following operations are available:

## error checking
- after editing a file, use `hover` on modified symbols to verify types are correct
- use `findReferences` before deleting or renaming functions to understand impact

## code exploration
- `goToDefinition`: trace where a function/class/variable is defined - essential for understanding unfamiliar code
- `findReferences`: find all usages of a symbol across the codebase
- `documentSymbol`: get an overview of all functions, classes, and variables in a file
- `workspaceSymbol`: search for symbols by name across the entire project
- `goToImplementation`: find concrete implementations of interfaces or abstract methods

## debugging & understanding call flow
- `hover`: inspect types, documentation, and inferred information for any symbol
- `incomingCalls`: find all functions that call a specific function (useful for tracing how code is reached)
- `outgoingCalls`: find all functions called by a specific function (useful for understanding dependencies)
- `prepareCallHierarchy`: get call hierarchy information for a function

## practical workflows
- **before refactoring**: use `findReferences` to understand all affected code
- **debugging a bug**: use `incomingCalls` to trace how a function is reached, `goToDefinition` to follow the data flow
- **understanding new code**: use `documentSymbol` for file overview, `hover` for type info, `goToDefinition` to dive deeper

# Tools

## Browser Tools

- Use `agent-browser` for most interactive browser work. It is the default choice for agent-driven exploration, iterative UI interaction, screenshots, and stateful sessions. Prefer it when you want AI-friendly page discovery via `snapshot` and stable element refs like `@e1`.
- Use `dev-browser` when you need programmable browser automation with Playwright-style APIs. Prefer it for scripted multi-step flows, reusable inspection scripts, or cases where `snapshotForAI()` plus direct `page` methods are the best fit.
- On this machine, `dev-browser` may work better with `--connect` to an existing Chrome/CDP session than by launching its bundled browser directly.
